            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154576:3"/>ſome Souldiers being there ſlaine, and 300. more taken priſoners, that made reſiſtance; and all theſe places will doubtleſſe fare the worſe, becauſe they refuſed <hi>Tortenſon</hi> entrance, when he firſt required it both by meſſage and writing. Yeſterday, by an expreſſe, I received a letter my ſelf from Colonell <hi>Dowglas</hi> (who as Major Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the left wing of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Armie) in theſe words, <hi>Viz.</hi> The ninth of this moneth we have begun our wars very fortunatly here in <hi>Juitland;</hi> in reſpect we did encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whole Cavalerie of the <hi>Danes</hi> in theſe parts; who were twelve hundred horſe ſtrong, of the beſt mounted manly-like-men, that ever I did ſee, a mile on this ſide <hi>Colding;</hi> and beate them ſo, as that there did not 200. come into their <hi>Leaguer,</hi> the moſt part of their Officers kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and their Principalls taken priſoners, as Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Bockwald</hi> (who commanded them) <hi>Ritmeiſter Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fild, Ritmeiſter Luke,</hi> and divers other <hi>Ritmeiſters, Lieutenants</hi> and under <hi>Officers:</hi> we are now lying here in the <hi>Dorpes</hi> about the King of Denmarks Foot, which lyes in a retren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Leaguer on this ſide of the <hi>Belt,</hi> over againſt <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in <hi>Funen;</hi> they are eſteemed 7 or 8 thouſand ſtrong, but more then the half part miſerable poore <hi>Bawres;</hi> we are about an exploit, which if it effectuate will make us a good warre. Thus far he. Now this day here is freſh newes come, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> with their Ordnance, were ſince advanced before this Leaguer; and that after they had Canoncerd upon it a while, and that the <hi>Danes</hi> ſaw them ready to make a faire aſſault upon them, they threw down their Armes, and cryed out for Quarter; the Marſhall of Denmarke <hi>Andreas Bilke</hi> (who Commanded in chiefe) ſeeing themſelves too weake to oppoſe the <hi>Swedes,</hi> tooke away their Colours, Ordnance, chief Officers, and as many of the beſt common Souldiers, as ſo ſhort time would give
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154576:3"/>him leave; and eſcaped therewith by ſmall ſhipping into <hi>Funen;</hi> yet left behinde them ſundry Captaines and under Officers, beſides all their Horſes, and foure thouſand five hundred Foot men, whereof one thouſand old Souldiers, and therewith many of the <hi>Bawres</hi> or <hi>Payſons</hi> alſo willingly ranged themſelves amongſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> Troupes; the reſt, after the Souldiers had ſtripped them of their beſt cloths, were ſent away unto their homes: This is the effect of a Letter ſent unto this Town, which was written by <hi>Torten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> himſelf; who added hereunto, that by this generall defeate of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Forces both Horſe and Foot, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the whole Continent on this ſide the <hi>Belt,</hi> to be as good as in their Poſſeſſion; and this letter of his I my ſelf have ſeen, bearing date at <hi>Middleford Skonce</hi> the 14. of this moneth. What the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> doth in <hi>Zealand, Funen,</hi> or <hi>Schonen,</hi> we know not, more then in generall, that he maketh all the preparation for the wars that he can: for all the Paſſages out of <hi>Denmark</hi> are ſtopped, ſo that we can have no certaine Intelligence from thence as yet. It hath been rumoured here abroad al this week that the States of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> were treating together upon the borders of both Kingdomes; and ſuch advertiſement was brought alſo unto the Chancellour of <hi>Denmark</hi> (who is yet here) as I had it from himſelf. But <hi>Lowis de Geere</hi> (a man of good account, and at this time employed from the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> for <hi>Holland</hi>) arrived here yeſterday, affirming that himſelf came by ſhipping from <hi>Calmar</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not far off the borders) the 12. of this moneth, and that then there was neither any ſuch meeting, nor yet any ſpeech thereof; but that <hi>Fieldmarſhall Guſtavius Horn</hi> had 20. thouſand men on Foote, and was with them to march into <hi>Denmark</hi> the 20. of this moneth. The Chancellour aforeſaid faith, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath in <hi>Schonen</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154576:4"/>13. or 14. thouſand men to make head againſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> there; and that 18 thouſand more are ſhortly to come out of <hi>Norwegen,</hi> but theſe being (for the moſt part) <hi>Payſans,</hi> not injured to the wars; it is to be feared that they will not be able to withſtand the fierce irruptions of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Armies; eſpecially ſeeing theſe laſt have had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuch ſucceſſe in their enterpriſes on this ſide the <hi>Belt.</hi> The Chancellour alſo let me underſtand that the King his Maſter, hath lately ſent unto him, and the reſt of his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues</hi> at <hi>Oſnabrugge,</hi> his Letters of revocation; requiring them to come away from thence with all expedition. So what will become of the generall Treaties when they are departed, we ſhall ſee ere long, at leaſt whither they will goe forward or not. We have nothing this weeke of the Imperiall Army above in High <hi>Germanie;</hi> ſave onely that they have betaken themſelves into their Winter Quarters.

From <hi>Danſick</hi> the <hi>Hollands</hi> Reſident writes of newes to be arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, out of <hi>Moravia,</hi> that the Emperours towns in <hi>Hungaria</hi> have declared <hi>Ragotzy</hi> for an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that he hath an Army on foot of above 30. thouſand men; and that the <hi>Turke</hi> will joyn unto them 24000. more to make war againſt the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;</hi> ſure it is, that he hath received monies from the crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> both; and this makes many to conjecture, that the Emperour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154576:5"/>will have work enough for his Armies above in the Countrey; and that the <hi>Swedes</hi> will have no diſturbance from thence unto their proceedings in theſe parts: others conceive that the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> have a purpoſe to make a particular peace with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that they may the better intend and purſue their new begun warre againſt the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and it is written from <hi>Leipſick,</hi> that they have a conference about this time with the Imperialiſts at <hi>Fridburg</hi> in <hi>Luſatia,</hi> about a truce, a little more time will give us more light to judge of the weight of theſe conjectures; but in the mean time, the <hi>Landgravin</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> hath ſent a principall Miniſter of Hers to expoſtulate with <hi>Tortenſon,</hi> for drawing away all his forces ſo far off from aſsiſting of Hers, and for beginning of this new war to ſtirr up more enemies againſt themſelves and their Allyes.
